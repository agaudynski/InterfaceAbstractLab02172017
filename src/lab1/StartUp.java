/*
This structure seems to work well, but only when you have very specific methods
and objects that share very similiar structures and do not vary greatly. I could
imagine that this type of architecture would be beneficil for instances where you
need to track and group objects differently by name, but maintain the same base
structure so that any changes to the super class can cascade down tothe sub classes.
This structure would also allow for quick additions and edits since everything is
inherited.
